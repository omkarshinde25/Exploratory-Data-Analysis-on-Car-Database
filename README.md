# Exploratory Data Analysis on Car Database
### Purpose of this project
1. To get hands on experience on sql and its capabilities
2. The project's goal is to explore the database and answer a series of questions using SQL.

* ##  Introdution Of Project
  #### --> The project is structured into seven parts, progressing from fundamental SQL commands to more advanced concepts. These parts cover:
    ##### 1. Basic Exploration: Simple queries for data retrieval.
    ##### 2. Joins Practice: Combining data from multiple tables.
    ##### 3. Aggregates & Grouping: Summarizing data using functions like COUNT and SUM.
    ##### 4. Subqueries & Insights: Using nested queries for complex data retrieval
    ##### 5. Stored Procedures: Creating reusable code blocks for specific tasks.
    ##### 6. Advanced Clauses: Using advanced features like HAVING and CASE.
    ##### 7. Business Insights: Answering specific business questions by applying all the skills learned
 <br>
